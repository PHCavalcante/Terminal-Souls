# Terminal-Souls

Terminal Souls is a `RPG/Soulslike` simple game made with `bash script` language.

It is currently in development and is not finished yet. It can be played already, but it is still short and have several bugs and erros that I have to fix.

If you have any suggestions or want to contribute with the project , feel free to open a pull request.
